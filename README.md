\*\* DISCLAIMER:\*\*

## &#x20;About

This repository contains:

* **Batch Prank Script** (`.bat`) that repeatedly opens new windows in an infinite loop.
* **EXE Version** (`.exe`) built from the batch script using **IExpress**, so it can run without opening a separate Command Prompt manually.

This prank makes the computer appear to be “overloaded,” forcing the user to restart or shut down the system.

## &#x20;How to Use

### BAT Version

1. Open `ExtremeBatchPrank.bat` via **Command Prompt** or simply double-click it.
2. To stop it, press **CTRL + C** or power off the PC.

### EXE Version

1. Run `ExtremeBatchPrank.exe` (built with IExpress).
2. Same effect as the BAT version, but runs more seamlessly.
3. To stop it, perform a **force shutdown/restart**.
